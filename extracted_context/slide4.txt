Machine Learning (ML)
ML is a branch of artificial intelligence:
Uses computing based systems to make sense out of data
Extracting patterns, fitting data to functions, classifying data, 
etc
ML systems can learn and improve
With historical data, time and experience
Bridges theoretical computer science and real noise data.

1. 
Earth is a habitable planet
Reveal Answer
YES
NO
2. 
We have 7 days in a week
3. 
We have 13 months in a year
4. 
1 minute is equal to 60 seconds
ML in real-life
Supervised and Unsupervised Learning 
Unsupervised Learning
There are 
not predefined and known set of outcomes
Look for 
hidden patterns and relations 
in the data
A typical example: 
Clustering
Supervised and Unsupervised Learning 
Supervised Learning
For every example in the data there is 
always a predefined outcome
Models the 
relations between a set of descriptive features and a target
 
(Fits data to a function)
2 groups of problems: 
Classification
Regression
Supervised Learning 
Classification
Predicts which class a given sample of data (sample  of descriptive features) is part of (
discrete value
). 
Regression
Predicts continuous
 
values. 
Machine Learning as a Process
- Define measurable and quantifiable goals
- Use this stage to learn about the problem
-
 
Normalization
- Transformation
- Missing Values 
- Outliers
-   
Data Splitting
Features Engineering
Estimating Performance
Evaluation and Model Selection 
Study models accuracy
    - Work better than the naïve  
       approach or previous system
Do the results make sense in the context of the problem
ML as a Process: Data Preparation
Needed for 
several reasons
Some Models have strict 
data requirements
Scale of the data, data point intervals, 
etc
Some characteristics of the data may 
impact dramatically on the model performance
Time on data preparation 
should not be underestimated
ML as a Process: Feature engineering
Determine the predictors (features) to be used is one of the most critical questions
Some times we need to add predictors
Reduce Number:
Fewer predictors 
more interpretable model and less costly
Most of the models are 
affected by high dimensionality
, specially 
for non-informative 
predictors
Binning
 
predictors
ML as a Process: Model Building
Data Splitting
Allocate data to different tasks
model training
performance evaluation
Define Training, Validation and Test sets
Feature Selection 
(Review the decision made previously)
Estimating Performance
Visualization of results 
– discovery interesting areas of the problem space
Statistics and performance measures
Evaluation and Model selection
The 
‘no free lunch’ 
theorem no a priory assumptions can be made
Avoid use of favorite models if NEEDED

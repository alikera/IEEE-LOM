Definition of Color
Physical aspects
color is a part of magnetic spectrum of visible light.
Perceptual aspects
amount made up by varying R, G and B colors.
cone cells in human eyes detecting color (one for each R, G and B color)
R, G, B = primary color
Primary and Secondary Colors
Primary colors: the color consist of 1 primary color
Secondary colors: the color consist of 2 primary colors
Primary and Secondary Colors (2)
two color models
Light Color Primaries (Red, Green, Blue)
Pigment Color Primaries (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow)  (CMYK
)
Color Model
A.k.a. color space, color system
Specify a color as a point in some standard coordinate
Popular color models:

Contrast Enhancement
Use histogram manipulation (E.g. histogram equalization) on only 
intensity
 
component.
Processing on

Edge Detection
Use edge detection on intensity component only
Use edge detection on R, G and B components separately and join the result
Rods and Cons
Humans normally have 
three types of cones
 
The first responds the most to light of long                                      wavelengths, peaking at about 560 nm ; this type is sometimes designated 
L
 for long. 
The second type responds the most to light of medium-wavelength, peaking at 530 nm, and is abbreviated 
M
 for medium. 
The third type responds the most to short-wavelength light, peaking at 420 nm, and is designated 
S
 for short. 
The three types have peak wavelengths near 564–580 nm, 534–545 nm, and 420–440 nm, respectively, depending on the individual.
The difference in the signals received from the three cone types allows the brain to perceive a continuous range of colors
Cone Details
Current understanding is that the 
6 to 7 million cones 
can be divided into "red" cones (64%), "green" cones (32%), and "blue" cones (2%) based on measured 
response curves
. 
The green and red cones are concentrated in the 
fovea centralis
 . 
The "blue" cones have the highest sensitivity and are mostly found outside the fovea, leading to some distinctions in the eye's 
blue perception
.
The cones are less sensitive to light than the 
rods
, as shown a typical 
day-night comparison
. The daylight vision (cone vision) adapts much more rapidly to changing light levels, adjusting to a change like coming indoors out of sunlight in a few seconds. 
Rod Details
The 
rods
 are the most numerous of the 
photoreceptors
, some 
120 million
, and are the more sensitive than the 
cones
. However, they are not sensitive to color. They are responsible for our dark-adapted, or 
scotopic
, vision. The rods are incredibly efficient photoreceptors. More than one thousand times as sensitive as the cones, they can reportedly be triggered by individual 
photons
 under optimal conditions. 
The optimum dark-adapted vision is obtained only after a considerable period of darkness, say 30 minutes or longer, because the rod adaption process is much slower than that of the cones.
